#API 
My first time successfully fetching data with an API.
The firstpage implements an onclick button with a search input field that takes the title of the movie you want and fetches the data
I used the OMDb API for movies
I had to request for an API key(I did not realize this at first and this was an issue)
The second page rendereds a list of actors.
The API was free and I did not have to use a key
Consuming this API was easier than the other one
I hope to work with more APIs and have a better grasps of API and consuming them
